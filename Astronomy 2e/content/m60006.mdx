Maps of the sky from the equator and the southern hemisphere can also be printed.
bullet Sky charts and other summaries of astronomical information can also be found at [temporarily unnamed link]().
bullet A free, open-source computer application that shows the sky at any time from any place is called Stellarium. You can find it at [temporarily unnamed link]().

If you have a smartphone, you can find a variety of inexpensive apps that allow you to simply hold your phone upward to see what is in the sky behind your phone.
bullet A *planisphere* is a sky chart that turns inside a round frame and can show you the night sky at your latitude on any date and time of the year. You can buy them at science supply and telescope stores or online. Or you can construct your own from templates at these two websites:
