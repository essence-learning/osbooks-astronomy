## Astronomy Websites, Images, and Apps
Throughout the textbook, we suggest useful resources for students on the specific topics in a given chapter. Here, we offer some websites for exploring astronomy in general, plus good sites for viewing and downloading the best astronomy images, and guides to astronomical apps for smartphones and tablets. This is not an exhaustive listing, but merely a series of suggestions to whet the appetite of those wanting to go beyond the textbook.

### Websites for Exploring Astronomy in General

### Astronomical Organizations

Amateur Astronomy Clubs. In most large cities and a number of rural areas, there are *amateur astronomy clubs*, where those interested in the hobby of astronomy gather to observe the sky, share telescopes, hear speakers, and help educate the public about the night sky. To find an astronomy club near you, you can try the following sites:
