<caption>Stars come in a variety of sizes, masses, temperatures, and luminosities. This image shows part of a cluster of stars in the <term class="no-emphasis">Small Magellanic Cloud</term> (catalog number NGC 290). Located about 200,000 light-years away, NGC 290 is about 65 light-years across. Because the stars in this cluster are all at about the same distance from us, the differences in apparent brightness correspond to differences in luminosity; differences in temperature account for the differences in color. The various colors and luminosities of these stars provide clues about their life stories. (credit: modification of work by E.

<para id="fs-id1164754905404">How do stars form? How long do they live? And how do they die? Stop and think how hard it is to answer these questions.</para>
<para id="fs-id1164754995087">Stars live such a long time that nothing much can be gained from staring at one for a human lifetime. To discover how stars evolve from birth to death, it was necessary to measure the characteristics of many stars (to take a celestial census, in effect) and then determine which characteristics help us understand the starsâ€™ life stories. Astronomers tried a variety of hypotheses about stars until they came up with the right approach to understanding their development. But the key was first making a thorough census of the stars around us.</para>
