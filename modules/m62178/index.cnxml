<para id="fs-id1163976778120">Saturn’s large ring system is made up of icy particles spread out into several vast, flat rings containing a great deal of fine structure. The Uranus and Neptune ring systems, on the other hand, are nearly the reverse of Saturn’s: they consist of dark particles confined to a few narrow rings with broad empty gaps in between. Jupiter’s ring and at least one of Saturn’s are merely transient dust bands, constantly renewed by dust grains eroded from small moons. In this section, we focus on the two most massive ring systems, those of Saturn and Uranus.</para>
<para id="para-00001">We should mention that the four giant planets are not the only worlds in the solar system now known to have rings. Recently, rings have been discovered around the dwarf planets Haumea and Quaoar (distant worlds that are discussed in The Origin and Fate of Comets and Related Objects) and at least one asteroid.</para>
<section id="fs-id1163976555691">
<title>What Causes Rings?</title>
<para id="fs-id1163973264772">A ring is a collection of vast numbers of particles, each like a tiny moon obeying Kepler’s laws as it follows its own orbit around the planet. Thus, the inner particles revolve faster than those farther out, and the ring as a whole does not rotate as a solid body. In fact, it is better not to think of a ring rotating at all, but rather to consider the revolution (or motion in orbit) of its individual moonlets.</para>
<para id="fs-id1163976785918">If the ring particles were widely spaced, they would move independently, like separate moonlets. However, in the main rings of Saturn and Uranus the particles are close enough to exert mutual gravitational influence, and occasionally even to rub together or bounce off each other in low-speed collisions. Because of these interactions, we see phenomena such as waves that move across the rings—just the way water waves move over the surface of the ocean.</para>
<para id="fs-id1163976917357">There are two basic ideas of how such rings come to be. First is the <emphasis effect="italics">breakup hypothesis</emphasis>, which suggests that the rings are the remains of a shattered moon. A passing comet or asteroid might have collided with the moon, breaking it into pieces. Tidal forces then pulled the fragments apart, and they dispersed into a disk. The second hypothesis, which takes the reverse perspective, suggests that the rings are made of particles that were unable to come together to form a moon in the first place.</para>
<para id="fs-id1163976663191">In either theory, the gravity of the planet plays an important role. Close to the planet (see <link target-id="OSC_Astro_12_04_FourRings"/>), tidal forces can tear bodies apart or inhibit loose particles from coming together. We do not know which explanation holds for any given ring, although many scientists have concluded that at least a few of the rings are relatively young and must therefore be the result of breakup.</para>

<para id="fs-id1163973249673"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">Saturn’s rings</term> are very broad and very thin. The width of the main rings is 70,000 kilometers, yet their average thickness is only 20 meters. If we made a scale model of the rings out of paper, we would have to make them 1 kilometer across. On this scale, Saturn itself would loom as high as an 80-story building. The ring particles are composed primarily of water ice, and they range from grains the size of sand up to house-sized boulders. An insider’s view of the rings would probably resemble a bright cloud of floating snowflakes and hailstones, with a few snowballs and larger objects, many of them loose aggregates of smaller particles (<link target-id="OSC_Astro_12_04_RingPartic"/>).</para>

</figure>
<para id="fs-id1163976543548">In addition to the broad A, B, and C Rings, Saturn has a handful of very narrow rings no more than 100 kilometers wide. The most substantial of these, which lies just outside the A Ring, is called the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">F Ring</term>; its surprising appearance is discussed below. In general, Saturn’s narrow rings resemble the rings of Uranus and Neptune.</para>
<para id="fs-id1163976656545">There is also a very faint, tenuous ring, called the E Ring, associated with Saturn’s small icy moon <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">Enceladus</term>. The particles in the E Ring are very small and composed of water ice. Since such a tenuous cloud of ice crystals will tend to dissipate, the ongoing existence of the E Ring strongly suggests that it is being continually replenished by a source at Enceladus. This icy moon is very small—only 500 kilometers in diameter—but the Voyager images showed that the craters on about half of its surface have been erased, indicating geological activity sometime in the past few million years. It was with great anticipation that the Cassini scientists maneuvered the spacecraft orbit to allow multiple close flybys of Enceladus starting in 2005.</para>
<para id="fs-id1163976472152">Those awaiting the Cassini flyby results were not disappointed. High-resolution images showed long, dark stripes of smooth ground near its south pole, which were soon nicknamed “tiger stripes” (<link target-id="OSC_Astro_12_04_Enceladus"/>). Infrared measurements revealed that these tiger stripes are warmer than their surroundings. Best of all, dozens of cryovolcanic vents on the tiger stripes were seen to be erupting geysers of salty water and ice (<link target-id="OSC_Astro_12_04_TigerStrip"/>). Estimates suggested that 200 kilograms of material were shooting into space each second—not a lot, but enough for the spacecraft to sample.</para>

<para id="fs-id1163976545181">When Cassini was directed to fly into the plumes, it measured their composition and found them to be similar to material we see liberated from comets (see <link document="m59865">Comets and Asteroids: Debris of the Solar System</link>). The vapor and ice plumes consisted mostly of water, but with trace amounts of nitrogen, ammonia, methane, and other hydrocarbons. Minerals found in the geysers in trace amounts included ordinary salt, meaning that the geyser plumes were high-pressure sprays of salt water.</para>
<para id="fs-id1163976536355">Based on the continuing study of Enceladus’ bulk properties and the ongoing geysers, in 2015 the Cassini mission scientists tentatively identified a subsurface ocean of water feeding the geysers. These discoveries suggested that in spite of its small size, Enceladus should be added to the list of worlds that we would like to explore for possible life. Since its subsurface ocean is conveniently escaping into space, it might be much easier to sample than the ocean of Europa, which is deeply buried below its thick crust of ice. Additional analyses of Cassini data in 2023 indicated the presence in the plumes of hydrogen cyanide, a key chemical compound for the origin of life.</para>

<para id="fs-id1163973188755"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">Uranus’ rings</term> are narrow and black, making them almost invisible from Earth. The nine main rings were discovered in 1977 from observations made of a star as Uranus passed in front of it. We call such a passage of one astronomical object in front of another an <emphasis effect="italics">occultation</emphasis>. During the 1977 occultation, astronomers expected the star’s light to disappear as the planet moved across it. But in addition, the star dimmed briefly several times before Uranus reached it, as each narrow ring passed between the star and the telescope. Thus, the rings were mapped out in detail even though they could not be seen or photographed directly, like counting the number of cars in a train at night by watching the blinking of a light as the cars successively pass in front of it. When Voyager approached Uranus in 1986, it was able to study the rings at close range; the spacecraft also photographed two new rings (<link target-id="OSC_Astro_12_04_NarrowRing"/>).</para>

The Epsilon Ring encircles Uranus at a distance of 51,000 kilometers, about twice the radius of Uranus. This ring probably contains as much mass as all of Uranus’ other ten rings combined; most of them are narrow ribbons less than 10 kilometers wide, just the reverse of the broad rings of Saturn.</para>

Organic material of this sort is rather common in the outer solar system. Many of the asteroids and comets are also composed of dark, tarlike materials. In the case of Uranus, its ten small inner moons have a similar composition, suggesting that one or more moons might have broken up to make the rings.</para>

<title>Interactions between Rings and Moons</title>
<para id="fs-id1163976498566">Much of our fascination with planetary rings is a result of their intricate structures, most of which owe their existence to the gravitational effect of moons, without which the rings would be flat and featureless. Indeed, it is becoming clear that without moons there would probably be no rings at all because, left to themselves, thin disks of small particles gradually spread and dissipate.</para>
<para id="fs-id1163976901377">Most of the gaps in <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">Saturn’s rings</term>, and also the location of the outer edge of the A Ring, result from gravitational resonances with small inner moons. A <term id="term-00019">resonance</term> takes place when two objects have orbital periods that are exact ratios of each other, such as 1:2 or 2:3. For example, any particle in the gap at the inner side of the Cassini Division of Saturn’s rings would have a period equal to one-half that of Saturn’s moon Mimas. Such a particle would be nearest Mimas in the same part of its orbit every second revolution. The repeated gravitational tugs of Mimas, acting always in the same direction, would perturb it, forcing it into a new orbit outside the gap. In this way, the Cassini Division became depleted of ring material over long periods of time.</para>
<para id="fs-id1163976916540">The Cassini mission revealed a great deal of fine structure in Saturn’s rings. Unlike the earlier Voyager flybys, Cassini was able to observe the rings for more than a decade, revealing a remarkable range of changes, on time scales from a few minutes to several years. Many of the features newly seen in Cassini data indicated the presence of condensations or small moons only a few tens of meters across imbedded in the rings. As each small moon moves, it produces waves in the surrounding ring material like the wake left by a moving ship. Even when the moon is too small to be resolved, its characteristic waves could be photographed by Cassini.</para>
<para id="fs-id1163976726357">One of the most interesting rings of Saturn is the narrow <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00020">F Ring</term>, which contains several apparent ringlets within its 90-kilometer width. In places, the F Ring breaks up into two or three parallel strands that sometimes show bends or kinks. Most of the rings of Uranus and Neptune are also narrow ribbons like the F Ring of Saturn. Clearly, the gravity of some objects must be keeping the particles in these thin rings from spreading out.</para>
<para id="fs-id1163976452746">As we have seen, the largest features in the rings of Saturn are produced by gravitational resonances with the inner moons, while much of the fine structure is caused by smaller embedded moons. In the case of Saturn’s F Ring, close-up images revealed that it is bounded by the orbits of two moons, called Pandora and Prometheus (<link target-id="OSC_Astro_12_04_FRing"/>). These two small moons (each about 100 kilometers in diameter) are referred to as <emphasis effect="italics">shepherd moons</emphasis>, since their gravitation serves to “shepherd” the ring particles and keep them confined to a narrow ribbon. A similar situation applies to the Epsilon Ring of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00021">Uranus</term>, which is shepherded by the moons Cordelia and Ophelia. These two shepherds, each about 50 kilometers in diameter, orbit about 2000 kilometers inside and outside the ring.</para>

(b) In this closer view, the shepherd moon Pandora (84 kilometers across) is seen next to the F ring, in which the moon is perturbing the main (brightest) strand of ring particles as it passes. You can see the dark side of Pandora on this image because it is being illuminated by the light reflected from Saturn.

</note>
<para id="fs-id1163973053426">Theoretical calculations suggest that the other narrow rings in the uranian and neptunian systems should also be controlled by shepherd moons, but none has been located. The calculated diameter for such shepherds (about 10 kilometers) was just at the limit of detectability for the Voyager cameras, so it is impossible to say whether they are present or not. (Given all the narrow rings we see, some scientists still hope to find another more satisfactory mechanism for keeping them confined.)</para>
<para id="fs-id1163976873279">One of the outstanding problems with understanding the rings is determining their ages. Have the giant planets always had the ring systems we see today, or might these be a recent or temporary, feature of the solar system? Most of the research on this problem concerns the rings of Saturn, which have been intensively studied, thanks to data from the Cassini mission that orbited Saturn for 13 years. The mass of these rings is about the same as that of the inner moon Mimas, suggesting that they could have been formed by the break-up of a similar icy moon. Such a violent event would have been more likely early in the history of the solar system, when there was more debris orbiting the Sun. However, recent analyses of Cassini data indicate that the rings may be relatively young, less than a few hundred million years old. The evidence is based on estimates of the inflow of dark, carbon-rich dust into the Saturn system, which would gradually darken the icy ring particles. Yet the rings of Saturn actually reflect light very well, meaning they are not particularly dark. The origin and age of the ring systems thus remains one of the intriguing mysteries of the solar system.</para>

<title>Key Concepts and Summary</title>
<para id="fs-id1163976438552">Rings are composed of vast numbers of individual particles orbiting so close to a planet that its gravitational forces could have broken larger pieces apart or kept small pieces from gathering together. Saturn’s rings are broad, flat, and nearly continuous, except for a handful of gaps. The particles are mostly water ice, with typical dimensions of a few centimeters. One Saturn moon, Enceladus, is today erupting geysers of water to maintain the tenuous E Ring, which is composed of very small ice crystals. The rings of Uranus are narrow ribbons separated by wide gaps and contain much less mass. Neptune’s rings are similar but contain even less material. Much of the complex structure of the rings is due to waves and resonances induced by moons within the rings or orbiting outside them. The origin and age of each of these ring systems is still a mystery.</para>

<title>Collaborative Group Activities</title>
<list id="fs-id1163973453373" list-type="enumerated" number-style="upper-alpha">
<item id="fs-id1000">Imagine it’s the distant future and humans can now travel easily among the planets. Your group is a travel agency, with the task of designing a really challenging tour of the Galilean moons for a group of sports enthusiasts. What kinds of activities are possible on each world? How would rock climbing on Ganymede, for example, differ from rock climbing on Earth? (If you design an activity for Io, you had better bring along very strong radiation shielding. Why?)</item>
<item id="fs-id1001">In the same spirit as <link target-id="fs-id1000">Activity A</link>, have your agency design a tour that includes the seven most spectacular sights of any kind on all the moons or rings covered in this chapter. What are the not-to-be-missed destinations that future tourists will want to visit and why? Which of the sights you pick are going to be spectacular if you are on the moon’s surface or inside the ring, and which would look interesting only from far away in space?</item>
<item id="fs-id1002">In this chapter we could cover only a few of the dozens of moons in the outer solar system. Using the Internet or your college library, organize your group into a research team and find out more about one of the moons we did not cover in detail. Our favorites include Uranus’ Miranda, with its jigsaw puzzle surface; Saturn’s Mimas, with a “knockout” crater called Herschel; and Saturn’s Iapetus, whose two hemispheres differ significantly. Prepare a report to attract tourists to the world you selected.</item>
<item id="fs-id1003">In a novel entitled <emphasis effect="italics">2010</emphasis>, science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke, inspired by the information coming back from the Voyager spacecraft, had fun proposing a life form under the ice of Europa that was evolving toward intelligence. Suppose future missions do indeed find some sort of life (not necessarily intelligent but definitely alive) under the ice of Europa—life that evolved completely independently from life on Earth. Have your group discuss what effect such a discovery would have on humanity’s view of itself. What should be our attitude toward such a life form? Do we have an obligation to guard it against contamination by our microbes and viruses? Or, to take an extreme position, should we wipe it out before it becomes competitive with Earth life or contaminates our explorers with microorganisms we are not prepared to deal with? Who should be in charge of making such decisions?</item>
<item id="fs-id1004">In the same spirit as <link target-id="fs-id1003">Activity D</link>, your group may want to watch the 2013 science fiction film <emphasis effect="italics">Europa Report.</emphasis> The producers tried to include good science in depicting what it would be like for astronauts to visit that jovian moon. How well does your group think they did?</item>
<item id="fs-id1005">A number of modern science fiction writers (especially those with training in science) have written short stories that take place on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. There is a topical listing of science fiction stories with good astronomy at http://bit.ly/astroscifi. Members of your group can look under “Jupiter” or “Saturn” and find a story that interests you and then report on it to the whole class.</item>
<item id="fs-id1006">Work together to make a list of all the reasons it is hard to send a mission to Pluto. What compromises had to be made so that the New Horizons mission was affordable? How would you design a second mission to learn more about the Pluto system?</item>
<item id="fs-id1007">Your group has been asked by NASA to come up with one or more missions to learn about Europa. Review what we know about this moon so far and then design a robotic mission that would answer some of the questions we have. You can assume that budget is not a factor, but your instruments have to be realistic. (Bear in mind that Europa is cold and far from the Sun.)</item>
<item id="fs-id1008">Imagine your group is the first landing party on Pluto (let’s hope you remembered to bring long underwear!). You land in a place where Charon is visible in the sky and you observe Charon for one Earth week. Describe what Charon will look like during that week. Now you move your camp to the opposite hemisphere of Pluto. What will Charon look like there during the course of a week?</item>
<item id="fs-id1009">When, in 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) decided that Pluto should be called a dwarf planet and not a planet, they set up three criteria that a world must meet to be called a planet. Your group should use the Internet to find these criteria. Which of them did Pluto not meet? Read a little bit about the reaction to the IAU’s decision among astronomers and the public. How do members of your group feel about Pluto’s new classification? (After you have discussed it within the group, you may want to watch <emphasis effect="italics">The Great Planet Debate</emphasis> video recommended in “For Further Exploration.”)</item>
