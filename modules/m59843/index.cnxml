Even from the distance of Earth, we can see surface features on Mars and follow the seasonal changes in its polar caps (<link target-id="OSC_Astro_10_04_MarsHST"/>). Although the surface today is dry and cold, evidence collected by spacecraft suggests that Mars once had blue skies and lakes of liquid water. Even today, it is the sort of place we can imagine astronauts visiting and perhaps even setting up permanent bases.</para>

<title>Spacecraft Exploration of Mars</title>
<para id="fs-id1168048346932">Mars has been intensively investigated by spacecraft. More than 50 spacecraft have been launched toward Mars, but only about half were fully successful. The first visitor was the US Mariner 4, which flew past Mars in 1965 and transmitted 22 photos to Earth. These pictures showed an apparently bleak planet with abundant impact craters. In those days, craters were unexpected; some people who were romantically inclined still hoped to see canals or something like them. In any case, newspaper headlines sadly announced that Mars was a “dead planet.”</para>
<para id="fs-id1168048274158">In 1971, NASA’s Mariner 9 became the first spacecraft to orbit another planet, mapping the entire surface of Mars at a resolution of about 1 kilometer and discovering a great variety of geological features, including volcanoes, huge canyons, intricate layers on the polar caps, and channels that appeared to have been cut by running water. Geologically, Mars didn’t look so dead after all.</para>
<para id="fs-id1168048696392">The twin Viking spacecraft of the 1970s were among the most ambitious and successful of all planetary missions. Two <emphasis effect="italics">orbiters</emphasis> surveyed the planet and served to relay communications for two <emphasis effect="italics">landers</emphasis> on the surface. After an exciting and sometimes frustrating search for a safe landing spot, the Viking 1 lander touched down on the surface of Chryse Planitia (the Plains of Gold) on July 20, 1976, exactly 7 years after Neil Armstrong’s historic first step on the Moon. Two months later, Viking 2 landed with equal success in another plain farther north, called Utopia. The landers photographed the surface with high resolution and carried out complex experiments searching for evidence of life, while the orbiters provided a global perspective on Mars geology.</para>
<para id="fs-id1168048593846">Mars languished unvisited for two decades after Viking. Two more spacecraft were launched toward Mars, by NASA and the Russian Space Agency, but both failed before reaching the planet.</para>
<para id="fs-id1168048739598">The situation changed, beginning in the 1990s, as NASA began a new exploration program using spacecraft that were smaller and less expensive than Viking. The first of the new missions, appropriately called Pathfinder, landed the first wheeled, solar-powered rover on the martian surface on July 4, 1997 (<link target-id="OSC_Astro_10_04_Pathfinder"/>). An orbiter called <emphasis effect="italics">Mars Global Surveyor</emphasis> (MGS) arrived a few months later and began high-resolution photography of the entire surface over more than one martian year. The most dramatic discovery by this spacecraft, which continued to operate until 2006, was evidence of gullies apparently cut by surface water, as we will discuss later. These missions were followed in 2003 by the NASA <emphasis effect="italics">Mars Odyssey</emphasis> orbiter, and the ESA <emphasis effect="italics">Mars Express</emphasis> orbiter, both carrying high-resolution cameras. A gamma-ray spectrometer on <emphasis effect="italics">Odyssey</emphasis> discovered a large amount of subsurface hydrogen (probably in the form of frozen water). Subsequent orbiters included the NASA <emphasis effect="italics">Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter</emphasis> to evaluate future landing sites, MAVEN to study the upper atmosphere, and India’s <emphasis effect="italics">Mangalayaan</emphasis>, also focused on study of Mars’ thin layers of air. Several of these orbiters are also equipped to communicate with landers and rovers on the surface and serve as data relays to Earth.</para>

<para id="fs-id1168046067250">In 2003, NASA began a series of highly successful Mars landers. Twin Mars Exploration Rovers (MER), named <emphasis effect="italics">Spirit</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">Opportunity</emphasis>, have been successful far beyond their planned lifetimes. The design goal for the rovers was 600 meters of travel; in fact, they have traveled jointly more than 50 kilometers. After scouting around its rim, <emphasis effect="italics">Opportunity</emphasis> drove down the steep walls into an impact crater called Victoria, then succeeded with some difficulty in climbing back out to resume its route (<link target-id="OSC_Astro_10_04_Victoria"/>). Dust covering the rovers’ solar cells caused a drop in power, but when a seasonal dust storm blew away the dust, the rovers resumed full operation. In order to survive winter, the rovers were positioned on slopes to maximize solar heating and power generation. In 2006, <emphasis effect="italics">Spirit</emphasis> lost power on one of its wheels, and subsequently became stuck in the sand, where it continued operation as a fixed ground station. Meanwhile, in 2008, <emphasis effect="italics">Phoenix</emphasis> (a spacecraft “reborn” of spare parts from a previous Mars mission that had failed) landed near the edge of the north polar cap, at latitude 68°, and directly measured water ice in the soil.</para>

<para id="fs-id1168048514502">In 2011, NASA launched its largest (and most expensive) Mars mission since Viking (see <link document="m59836" target-id="OSC_Astro_10_00_SpiritRov"/>). The 1-ton rover <emphasis effect="italics">Curiosity</emphasis>, the size of a subcompact car, has plutonium-powered electrical generators, so that it is not dependent on sunlight for power. <emphasis effect="italics">Curiosity</emphasis> made a pinpoint landing on the floor of Gale crater, a site selected for its complex geology and evidence that it had been submerged by water in the past. Previously, Mars landers had been sent to flat terrains with few hazards, as required by their lower targeting accuracy. The scientific goals of <emphasis effect="italics">Curiosity</emphasis> include investigations of climate and geology, and assessment of the habitability of past and present Mars environments. In 2018, NASA’s InSight Lander touched down on Mars, carrying a suite of scientific instruments. These include a package (nicknamed “the mole”) that will dig into the surface of Mars 1 mm at a time, hoping to reach a depth of 5 meters with heat sensors. Neither of these missions carries a specific life detection instrument, however. So far, scientists have not been able to devise a simple instrument that could distinguish living from nonliving materials on Mars.</para>
<para id="newmars">In 2021, NASA landed another large rover called <emphasis effect="italics">Perseverance</emphasis>, partly to collect geological samples for eventual return to Earth by an international follow-up mission. <emphasis effect="italics">Perseverance</emphasis> carried a small helicopter called <emphasis effect="italics">Ingenuity</emphasis>, which successfully flew in the thin martian air.

<title>Martian Samples</title>
<para id="fs-id1168048566815">Much of what we know of the Moon, including the circumstances of its origin, comes from studies of lunar samples, but spacecraft have not yet returned martian samples to Earth for laboratory analysis. It is with great interest, therefore, that scientists have discovered that samples of martian material are nevertheless already here on Earth, available for study. These are all members of a rare class of <emphasis effect="italics">meteorites</emphasis> (<link target-id="OSC_Astro_10_04_Meteorite"/>)—rocks that have fallen from space.</para>

</figure>
<para id="fs-id1168048358608">How would rocks have escaped from Mars? Many impacts have occurred on the red planet, as shown by its heavily cratered surface. Fragments blasted from large impacts can escape from Mars, whose surface gravity is only 38% of Earth’s. A long time later (typically a few million years), a very small fraction of these fragments collide with Earth and survive their passage through our atmosphere, just like other meteorites. (We’ll discuss meteorites in more detail in the chapter on <link document="m59870">Cosmic Samples and the Origin of the Solar System</link>.) By the way, rocks from the Moon have also reached our planet as meteorites, although we were able to demonstrate their lunar origin only by comparison with samples returned by the Apollo missions</para>
<para id="fs-id1168048467279">Most of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">martian meteorites</term> are volcanic basalts; most of them are also relatively young—about 1.3 billion years old. We know from details of their composition that they are not from Earth or the Moon. Besides, there was no volcanic activity on the Moon to form them as recently as 1.3 billion years ago. It would be very difficult for ejecta from impacts on Venus to escape through its thick atmosphere. By the process of elimination, the only reasonable origin seems to be Mars, where the Tharsis volcanoes were active at that time.</para><para id="fs-id1168048471424">The martian origin of these meteorites was confirmed by the analysis of tiny gas bubbles trapped inside several of them. These bubbles match the atmospheric properties of Mars as first measured directly by Viking. It appears that some atmospheric gas was trapped in the rock by the shock of the impact that ejected it from Mars and started it on its way toward Earth.</para>
<para id="fs-id1168046132079">One of the most exciting results from analysis of these martian samples has been the discovery of both water and organic (carbon-based) compounds in them, which suggests that Mars may once have had oceans and perhaps even life on its surface. As we have already hinted, there is other evidence for the presence of flowing water on Mars in the remote past, and even extending to the present.</para>

<title>Global Properties of Mars</title>
<para id="fs-id1168048367828"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">Mars</term> has a diameter of 6790 kilometers, just over half the diameter of Earth, giving it a total surface area very nearly equal to the continental (land) area of our planet. Its overall density of 3.9 g/cm<sup>3</sup> suggests a composition consisting primarily of silicates but with a small metal core. The planet has no global magnetic field, although there are areas of strong surface magnetization that indicate that there was a global field billions of years ago. Apparently, the red planet has no liquid material in its core today that would conduct electricity.</para>

Like Earth, the Moon, and Venus, the surface of Mars has continental or highland areas as well as widespread volcanic plains.

<para id="fs-id1168048563004">Images taken from orbit allow scientists to search for impact craters on the slopes of these volcanoes in order to estimate their age. Many of the volcanoes show a fair number of such craters, suggesting that they ceased activity a billion years or more ago. However, Olympus Mons has very, very few impact craters. Its present surface cannot be more than about 100 million years old; it may even be much younger. Some of the fresh-looking lava flows might have been formed a hundred years ago, or a thousand, or a million, but geologically speaking, they are quite young. This leads geologists to the conclusion that Olympus Mons possibly remains intermittently active today—something future Mars land developers may want to keep in mind.</para>

<title>Martian Cracks and Canyons</title>
<para id="fs-id1168048406635">The Tharsis bulge has many interesting geological features in addition to its huge volcanoes. In this part of the planet, the surface itself has bulged upward, forced by great pressures from below, resulting in extensive tectonic cracking of the crust. Among the most spectacular tectonic features on Mars are the canyons called the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">Valles Marineris</term> (or Mariner Valleys, named after Mariner 9, which first revealed them to us), which are shown in <link target-id="OSC_Astro_10_04_Canyonland"/>. They extend for about 5000 kilometers (nearly a quarter of the way around Mars) along the slopes of the Tharsis bulge. If it were on Earth, this canyon system would stretch all the way from Los Angeles to Washington, DC. The main canyon is about 7 kilometers deep and up to 100 kilometers wide, large enough for the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River to fit comfortably into one of its side canyons. Viewers of the movie “The Martian” can see a recreation of these canyonlands, as the film’s hero takes a long trip through a spectacular (and somewhat exaggerated) presentation of this part of Mars.</para>

<para id="fs-id1168046019612">The term “canyon” is somewhat misleading here because the Valles Marineris canyons have no outlets and were not cut by running water. They are basically tectonic cracks, produced by the same crustal tensions that caused the Tharsis uplift. However, water has played a later role in shaping the canyons, primarily by seeping from deep springs and undercutting the cliffs. This undercutting led to landslides that gradually widened the original cracks into the great valleys we see today (<link target-id="OSC_Astro_10_04_Landslides"/>). Today, the primary form of erosion in the canyons is probably wind.</para>

In part, this may reflect a lower general level of geological activity, as would be expected for a smaller planet. But it is also possible that evidence of widespread faulting has been buried by wind-deposited sediment over much of Mars.

Instruments on the landers found that the soil consisted of clays and iron oxides, as had long been expected from the red color of the planet. All the rocks measured appeared to be of volcanic origin and roughly the same composition. Later landers were targeted to touch down in areas that apparently were flooded sometime in the past, where sedimentary rock layers, formed in the presence of water, are common.

The lowest air temperatures, measured farther north by Viking 2, were about 173 K (–100 °C). During the winter, Viking 2 also photographed water frost deposits on the ground (<link target-id="OSC_Astro_10_04_WaterFrost"/>).

<para id="fs-id1168048332894">Most of the winds measured on Mars are only a few kilometers per hour. However, Mars is capable of great windstorms that can shroud the entire planet with windblown dust. Such high winds can strip the surface of some of its loose, fine dust, leaving the rock exposed. The later rovers found that each sunny afternoon the atmosphere became turbulent as heat rose off the surface. This turbulence generated dust devils, which play an important role in lifting the fine dust into the atmosphere. As the dust devils strip off the top layer of light dust and expose darker material underneath, they can produce fantastic patterns on the ground (<link target-id="OSC_Astro_10_04_DustDevils"/>).</para>
<para id="fs-id1168048406640">Wind on Mars plays an important role in redistributing surface material. <link target-id="OSC_Astro_10_04_DustDevils"/> shows a beautiful area of dark sand dunes on top of lighter material. Much of the material stripped out of the martian canyons has been dumped in extensive dune fields like this, mostly at high latitudes.</para>

<caption>(a) This high-resolution photo from the <emphasis effect="italics">Mars Global Surveyor</emphasis> shows the dark tracks of several dust devils that have stripped away a thin coating of light-colored dust. This view is of an area about 3 kilometers across. Dust devils are one of the most important ways that dust gets redistributed by the martian winds. They may also help keep the solar panels of our rovers free of dust. (b) These windblown sand dunes on Mars overlay a lighter sandy surface. Each dune in this high-resolution view is about 1 kilometer across.

<title>Key Concepts and Summary</title>
<para id="fs-id1168048277670">Most of what we know about Mars is derived from spacecraft: highly successful orbiters, landers, and rovers. We have also been able to study a few martian rocks that reached Earth as meteorites. Mars has heavily cratered highlands in its southern hemisphere, but younger, lower volcanic plains over much of its northern half. The Tharsis bulge, as big as North America, includes several huge volcanoes; Olympus Mons is more than 20 kilometers high and 500 kilometers in diameter. The Valles Marineris canyons are tectonic features widened by erosion. Early landers revealed only barren, windswept plains, but later missions have visited places with more geological (and scenic) variety. Landing sites have been selected in part to search for evidence of past water.</para>
